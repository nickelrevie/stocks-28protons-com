A rough list of ideas likely to be implemented in the future. Nothing on here is guaranteed to appear in a future version.

- Have a database of valid stock symbols that is regularly updated.
- Ability to eliminate invalid stocks that the user inputs and returns which ones are invalid.
- Ability to have the search box search the valid stock symbols and allow the user to select the stock.
- Modify the current stock list system to support displaying multiple stock prices, but also support the search within the search box.
- Night mode toggle on the page.
- Show stock charts for the market information
- Ability to click on a stock on the main list to either redirect to a new indepth page or expand to show a more indepth stock window.
    - Indepth page would include many more fields of information including a stock chart.
- Creating a login system so that users may register and save which stocks they would like to display or frequently check.
    - Possibly allow users to input how many shares they own so that they can more easily track their performance day-to-day.
